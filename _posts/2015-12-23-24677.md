title: "Koreans in U.S. Support Mass Campaign in S. Korea"
---
Koreans in the U.S. staged a demonstration in Los Angeles and Washington
on Dec. 18 and 19 in solidarity with the third all-out mass campaign in
south Korea.
The demonstrators extended support and solidarity to the campaign of
south Koreans against the unpopular rule by the south Korean regime that
took power through rigging in the 2012 election.
Sniping at Park Geun Hye for masterminding the illegal election to
become president, they demanded her regime's resignation.
They chanted slogans calling for a proper probe into the truth behind
the Ferry Sewol disaster, south Korean regime's retraction of its plan
to introduce "state-compiled history textbooks" and stop to its
retrogressive revision of the labor law and unreasonable suppression
under the pretext of security.
